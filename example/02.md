# Symmetric Key Cryptography

Alice and Bob can use a [symmetric key algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm), in which a secret **key** is used to encrypt and decrypt data so Eve cannot make sense of it.

- Think of the algorithm as two functions, their implementation details are public, but security lies in the key.

  ```
  encrypt(plaintext, key) = ciphertext
  decrypt(ciphertext, key) = plaintext
  ```

In fact, `XOR` works great as an encryption/decryption function [[why?](https://ctf101.org/cryptography/what-is-xor/)]

- Create a script `xor.py`

   ```python
   data = 'CAPTURETHEFLAG'
   key = 'A'
   
   encrypted = ''.join([chr(ord(x) ^ ord(key)) for x in data])
   print(f"Encrypted Message: {encrypted.encode()}")
   
   decrypted = ''.join([chr(ord(x) ^ ord(key)) for x in encrypted])
   print(f"Decrypted Message: {decrypted}")
   ```

- Run the script

   ```bash
   python3 xor.py
   ```

## Exercise 1

A 1-byte key is obviously not secure, prove it by writing some Python to decrypt this ciphertext

```plaintext
0,,(+bww:1,v4!wl4\x15>:\x13a
```

The text was encrypted using the same code, but using a different 1-byte key.
