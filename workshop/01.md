# How it works?

Two deployment modes: Containers or a Virtual Machine.

- The container environment is based on an [unminimized](https://git.launchpad.net/unminimize/tree/unminimize) Ubuntu 24.04 docker container with essential tools installed (check [Dockerfile](https://github.com/sh3b0/interactive-labs/tree/main/labenv/Dockerfile)).
  - Access to the docker engine of the host is possible via a bind-mount docker socket (aka. Docker outside of Docker).
  - The setup is not secure for remote deployment, the environment is intended to be only run locally (only use `-p127.0.0.1:<port>:<port>"` for containerized apps)

- The VM environment is based on [cloud-image/ubuntu-24.04](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/vagrant/discover/cloud-image/ubuntu-24.04) box built with packer (check [labenv.pkr.hcl](https://github.com/sh3b0/interactive-labs/tree/main/labenv/labenv.pkr.hcl)). The VM runs another compose file with a smaller debian-based container.

  - The default VM credentials are `vagrant:vagrant`

## Workflow for Educator

1. Prepare `workshop` content (a directory with ordered `.md` files and an optional reporting `template.markdown`)
1. Customize `docker-compose.yaml` or `Vagrantfile` with the necessary infrastructure needed for the workshop.
1. Distribute the files to the students (an archive or git repository)

## Workflow for Students

1. Obtain workshop resources from an educator (`workshop` directory and `docker-compose.yaml` or `Vagrantfile`)
1. Install Docker + Compose or Vagrant + Virtualbox/libvirt
1. Run the environment with `docker compose up` or `vagrant up`
1. Access only locally at <http://localhost:3000>
