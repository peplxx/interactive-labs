# Reporting Template

> Author: Name Surname (<n.surname@example.com>)

## Instructions

- The content you're reading is loaded from `workshop/README.md` into the labenv "Reporting" tab on every page load.
- Further changes from the UI are auto-saved to the file (overwriting any previous content)
- Press `Ctrl+P` to print this report (A5 papers look decent), or manually export `README.md` using an external tool (e.g., `markdown-to-pdf` VSCode extension)

## Reporting Approach

A good technical report resembles a tutorial ready to be posted on your blog.

1. Clarify used commands or scripts with short explanation.
   
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   
   int main() {
       std::cout << "Hello World!";
       return 0;
   }
   ```

2. Include a screenshot of relevant results when appropriate.
   
   > You can store the image locally or use a hosted service like [Imgur](https://imgur.com/upload).
   
    ![result](https://i.imgur.com/hO0tPAb.png)

3. Be brief and concise, nobody likes reading too much text.

## Report Quality Checklist

- [x] Author name and related info on the top
- [x] Exported to a convenient format (PDF, HTML)
- [ ] Related artifacts (code, configs, binaries) are included if present.
- [ ] The file has a meaningful name.
