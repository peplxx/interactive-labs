# Reporting Template

> Author: Name Surname (<n.surname@example.com>)

## Instructions

- The content you're reading is loaded from `workshop/README.md` into the labenv "Reporting" tab on every page load.
- Further changes from the UI are auto-saved to the file (overwriting any previous content)
- Press `Ctrl+P` to print this report (A5 papers look decent), or manually export `README.md` using an external tool (e.g., `markdown-to-pdf` VSCode extension)
- To include an image, write `![]()` in a new block, it should prompt for the image URL (you can upload image to a sevice like [Imgur](https://imgur.com/) to get a direct link)
