# Lab Environment

Hello there!

If you're seeing this description with a live terminal on the right, you've successfully started the lab environment.

## Playground

We've prepared a terminal environment for you to learn and experiment.

- The container environment is based on an [unminimized](https://git.launchpad.net/unminimize/tree/unminimize) Ubuntu 24.04 docker container with essential tools installed (check [Dockerfile](https://github.com/sh3b0/interactive-labs/tree/main/terminal/Dockerfile) used). Access to the docker engine of the host is possible via a bind-mount docker socket.

- The VM environment is based on [cloud-image/ubuntu-24.04](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/vagrant/discover/cloud-image/ubuntu-24.04) box.

- Use the `+` button to open a new terminal, or open a web page at `[title|][ip:]port`, specifying an optional tab title. If `ip` is omitted, the current `window.location.hostname` is used.

## Tooling

This terminal environment uses [Fish](https://fishshell.com/) shell running in [Zellij](https://zellij.dev/documentation/) terminal workspace

- You can customize the terminal looks or behavior at `workspace/.config/zellij/`
- Use `Alt + [` and `Alt + ]` for horizontal and vertical terminal splitting, respectively.

## Recording

- The terminal session is being recorded with [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/).

- Once you `exit` the terminal (Ctrl+D), the recording can be uploaded to your channel, make sure you create an account to keep the recording available.

- Recordings are available in your workspace directory. You can upload the them manually with `asciinema upload <cast_file>`.

## External environment

If you prefer to use your host's environment, simply install an ssh server on your host (e.g., `sudo apt install openssh-server`) then connect to it from lab terminal like `ssh $HOST_USERNAME@$DOCKER_GATEWAY`

You can also connect to cloud instance or a local VM's guest in a similar way.
