# Lab Environment

Hello there!

If you're seeing this description with a live terminal on the right, you've successfully started the lab environment.

## Terminal

- The terminal environment uses [Fish](https://fishshell.com/) shell running in [Zellij](https://zellij.dev/documentation/) terminal workspace.

- Terminal sessions are automatically recorded with [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/).

- Once you `exit` the terminal (Ctrl+D), the recording can be uploaded to your account.

## Workspace

On first start, a `workspace` directory is created on your host, synced with the environment's terminal home directory. It serves as a workarea for accessing shared files, configuring containerized apps, and persisting files across environment restarts. Contents include:

- `.config`: tool-specific configs (e.g., `~/.config/zellij/config.kdl`)
- `downloads`: files downloaded from the browser.
- `recordings`: asciinema `.cast` files of terminal sessions.
- `report`: workarea for the markdown report editor.
- `entrypoint` (fish script): the starting logic of the web terminal.

## External environment

If you prefer to use your host's environment (or any remote host), simply install an SSH server on the host (e.g., `sudo apt install openssh-server`) then connect to it from lab terminal with

```bash
ssh $HOST_USERNAME@$NETWORK_GATEWAY
```
