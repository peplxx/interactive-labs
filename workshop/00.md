# Lab Environment

Hello there!

If you're seeing this description with a live terminal on the right, you've successfully started the lab environment.

## Playground

We've prepared a terminal environment for you to learn and experiment.

- It's based on an [unminimized](https://git.launchpad.net/unminimize/tree/unminimize) Ubuntu 24.04 docker container with essential tools installed (check [Dockerfile](https://github.com/sh3b0/interactive-labs/tree/main/terminal/Dockerfile) used)
- Access to the docker engine of the host is possible via a bind-mount docker socket.
- Use the `+` button to open a new terminal, or open a tab to `[ip:]port`

## Tooling

This terminal environment uses [Fish](https://fishshell.com/) shell running in [Zellij](https://zellij.dev/documentation/) terminal workspace

- You can customize the terminal looks or behavior from `~/.config/zellij/`
- Use `Alt + [` and `Alt + ]` for horizontal and vertical terminal splitting, respectively.
