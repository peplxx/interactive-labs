# Lab Environment

Hello there!

If you're seeing this description with a live terminal on the right, you've successfully started the lab environment.

## Playground

We've prepared a terminal environment for you to learn and experiment.

- It's based on an [unminimized](https://git.launchpad.net/unminimize/tree/unminimize) Ubuntu 24.04 docker container with essential tools installed (check [Dockerfile](https://github.com/sh3b0/interactive-labs/tree/main/terminal/Dockerfile) used)

- Access to the docker engine of the host is possible via a bind-mount docker socket.

- Use the `+` button to open a new terminal, or open a tab to `[ip:]port`

## Tooling

This terminal environment uses [Fish](https://fishshell.com/) shell running in [Zellij](https://zellij.dev/documentation/) terminal workspace

- You can customize the terminal looks or behavior at `workspace/.config/zellij/`
- Use `Alt + [` and `Alt + ]` for horizontal and vertical terminal splitting, respectively.

## Recording

- The terminal session is being recorded with [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/).

- Once you `exit` the terminal (Ctrl+D), the recording can be uploaded to your channel, make sure you create an account to keep the recording available.

- Recordings are available in your workspace directory. You can upload the them with `asciinema upload <cast_file>`.

## Using host terminal

If you prefer to use your host's environment, simply install an ssh server on your host (e.g., `sudo apt install openssh-server`) then connect to it from lab terminal like `ssh <USER>@<DOCKER_BRIDGE_IP>`
