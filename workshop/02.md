# Applications

One can launch and access any containerized application from within the environment. The default setup comes with Firefox (port 5800), and code-server (port 8080).

> Specific commands depend on the deployment method used. Below snippets assume the application container mode (i.e., `docker-compose.yaml`) is used.

## Nginx

1. Run an nginx server

    ```bash
    docker run --rm -it -p80:80 --name nginx --network lab_net nginx:alpine
    ```

1. Write `80` in the input field and click `+` to open it in a new tab.

1. Server is also reachable from other containers in the `lab_net` (e.g., the browser) by name

    ```bash
    ping http://nginx:80
    ```

## Windows Environemnt

1. Create a `docker-compose.yaml` to launch a Windows environment based on [dockur/windows](https://github.com/dockur/windows).

    ```yaml
    services:
      windows:
        image: sh3b0/win:latest
        container_name: windows
        devices:
        - /dev/kvm
        - /dev/net/tun
        cap_add:
        - NET_ADMIN
        ports:
        - 8006:8006
        volumes:
        - ./workspace:/shared
        networks:
        - lab_net
        restart: unless-stopped
        stop_grace_period: 2m
    networks:
      lab_net:
        external: true
    ```

1. Pull and run the container

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

1. Write `Windows|8003` in the input field and click `+` to open it in a new tab.
